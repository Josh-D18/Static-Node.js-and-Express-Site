    h1 My Portfolio

    p Hi, my name is Josh Date. I'm a full stack Web Developer in the making! This is my portfolio where I can show off a few of the applications/projects I have built.


  article.portfolio-project-thumbs
    .projects-box.box.grid
      each project in projects 
        .cell
          a(href=`/projects/${project.id}`)
            img.thumbnail(src=`${project.image_urls[0]}`, alt='', target="_blank")
            h5 #{project.project_name}
